# Build a YouTube Clone Application Using React

[Original tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPVzx1ZOVuw)

**.env** file with SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY not included.

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
